## Files
This repository contains the following files:
- `evaluation`: Raw evaluation results, model predictions, source code for benchmark runs
- `figures`: Thesis figures, source code for figures
- `models`: Model snapshots (git excluded), model training data
- `training`: Source code for training and fine-tuning

## Training Data

The models were fine-tuned on 177 270 images (29 545 per continent) sourced from Mapillary.

## Demo and Models
Demo hosted on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/spaces/jrheiner/thesis-demo

Final model snapshots are available on Hugging Face: 
- https://huggingface.co/jrheiner/thesis-clip-geoloc-continent (optimized for continent queries)
- https://huggingface.co/jrheiner/thesis-clip-geoloc-country (optimized for country queries)  

*Snapshots of all evaluated models are not part of the Git repository due to their large file size and are available at request.*
